        introduction: |
          This menu contains all the content needed for the website interface, like the title of a page or a confirmation message.<br/>
          Most of those fields are plain text, but some contains particularities to fit some special needs:
        example: Example
        dynamic:
            title: Dynamic values
            description: |
              Some translations contains dynamic values<br/>
              Those values are surrounded by the '<strong>%</strong>' character.<br/>
              They don't need to be translated since there are keys, not the final text.
            example: |
              <code>Hello %firstname% %lastname%</code><br/>
              can be translated by<br/>
              <code>Bonjour %firstname% %lastname%</code><br/>
        plural:
            title: Pluralization
            description: |
              Some translations depends on a given number<br/>
              They can answer to different cases.<br/>
              The structure must therefore stay the same, only the text within needs to be translated
            example: |
              Translating a search result could show, depending on the amount of results found:<br/>
              <strong>"No results", "1 result", "x results"</strong><br/><br/>
              A specific syntax is then taken into account:<br/>
              <code>{0}No results|{1}1 result|]1,Inf]%count% results</code><br/>
              can be translated by<br/>
              <code>{0}Aucun résultat|{1}1 résultat|]1,Inf]%count% résultats</code><br/>
