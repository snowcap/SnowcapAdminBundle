SnowcapAdminBundle
==================

The SnowcapAdminBundle provides backfoffice capabilities for your Symfony2 application.

Features include:

- Basic CRUD capabilities
- A Datalist component
- Form type extensions (autocomplete, advanced file field, ...)
- Translation interface

**Caution:** This bundle is developed in sync with [symfony's repository](https://github.com/symfony/symfony).
For Symfony 2.1.x, you need to use the 2.1.x branch of the bundle.

**Warning:** This bundle is still pretty much WIP. If you are looking for an admin bundle with a lof of community attention,
you should probably look at [SonataAdminBundle](https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataAdminBundle).
